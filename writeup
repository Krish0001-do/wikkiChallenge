Title: wikki â€” Obfuscated C skeleton
Author: karan
Difficulty: Very easy 
Files: wikki.c(compiled)
Goal: Run the binary / inspect the source to obtain the flag.

Summary

This is a small obfuscated C wikki that uses multiple preprocessor macros and junk functions to look complicated. The program prints a hard-coded flag string when run. The "hard" part is only reading through the clutter; functionality is trivial: the program emits flag characters from an array.

Flag: flag{hi_all_wElcomE_this_task}
